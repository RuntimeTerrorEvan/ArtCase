     <h3> <i>Unknown Boundaries, 2020</i> </h3>

    </center>

    <p>Kellan Shanahan aims to create artworks that are beautiful but not naive, critical but not ironic, and that bring metaphysics and aesthetic contemplation back into the fold of contemporary art. Drawing from a broad field of philosophy, abstract mathematics, logic, science, and myth, his work explores the underlying patterns and recursions in reality that scale throughout time and space. </p>

     <h3> <i>Desert Mouse (2020)</i> </h3>

    </center>
    
    <p>The drawings feature a tiny masked mouse caught up in the coronavirus quarantine. The artist is Raymond Lau of Vancouver. Lau and his wife, Peo Ting, were among hundreds of real passengers isolated aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, then transferred into quarantine at the Nav Centre in Cornwall, Ont. They were finally released Friday after 14 days.This desert image captures Lau's feelings of loneliness and helplessness. "It was a way of expressing my emotions. I had to find something to do. Being in quarantine in a contained area is quite boring," said Lau, who creates similar images for fun at home in Vancouver. The images capture Lau's feelings of loneliness and helplessness while in quarantine. The images drawn at the Nav Centre capture the feeling of being fenced in and unable to leave.</p>

     <h3> <i>The Screen Age (2020)  </i> </h3>

    </center>
    
    <p>After the COVID-19 restrictions took effect, and OCAD University closed its doors, we quickly switched to online learning to complete the semester. In this unprecedented and unique time, we had no idea how our Drawing and Painting students might respond to the pandemic.
        They had very little access to art supplies and no access to studios. They had been physically separated from their classmates and faculty. These restrictions were also compounded by the broader societal pressures of the pandemic that are affecting all areas of our lives.
        However, one week after the shutdown, we began to see unbelievable art by our students being posted on Instagram. Shockingly beautiful pieces that directly responded to the new and surreal world that COVID-19 has created. Our students’ resiliency and creativity in the artworks were breathtaking in their scope.  
        The resulting work is thoughtful, sensitive, and visually communicates what many are experiencing on an emotional and physical level. Themes like anxiety, insomnia, and loneliness, emerged from figurative and abstracted drawings, paintings and textile work. Students interested in realism began to interpret the city and spaces that were void of people. Students switched to digital platforms and began to create work about technology and its sudden surge in our daily lives. Those without materials grabbed what they could find in their houses and began making work from upcycled recycling and tearing down old works to make new ones.

    <p>“I spent the first week of quarantine creating this piece for my thesis final. With a slight emphasis on pattern repetition and minimal colour use, this image depicts the weight of tradition, identity, and emotion on the female form. In many ways, this work also represents my emotional state during these unprecedented times.”</p>

     <h3> <i>Untitled (2020)</i> </h3>   

    </center>
    
    <p> "My paintings depict a two-fold process of alienation from nature and attempted reconciliation with it in times of Corona pandemic. To convey this message and using a combination of acrylic, markers, oil and pastels, I try to envision how the Corona pandemic has ironically created a new is and fragmented horizon of possibility for human reconciliation with nature. I try to depict this as a  dialectic between lines and colors where the former points to estrangement from nature and the latter signals possibility of reconciliation with nature.”</p>

    <p> “My Poetics of Proximity series was inspired by the quantity of time I must now spend in close proximity to those stuck with me in quarantine, the denial of proximity required by physical distancing in public, and how my proximity to others is redefined by technologies such as Zoom and Instagram. There is something beautiful and compelling about how I must navigate proximity differently now. I believe human emotions and desires, both good and bad are heightened by the profound changes in the ways in which we are currently forced to interact. I have chosen to express this intensified state with a celebration of color and the uniquely human action of brushwork. I use a lot of water for this type of work which can take a long time to evaporate in order create the effect I am looking for. My perception of time has been changed by how quarantine makes everything bleed into everything else. I love the idea of an image being a collection of little pools of color that in time might migrate toward one another.” </p>

     <h3> <i> Sudden Tranquility, Drowning in Waves (2020) </i> </h3>

    </center>
    
    <p> ““This piece touches upon the recent situation regarding the pandemic. In the beginning, people described a symptom of COVID-19 as feeling like they are being drowned and unable to breathe. This is based on an underwater theme. To add on, it may be boring in the house in quarantine, but many are working their best to help those who are under the weather. It was a very unexpected turn of events and the process may be taking a toll on people as life-turning events, concerts and our daily routines are being put on hold. The colour pallet and forms created are to represent the uncertainty of unexpected events. I was mainly painting what I felt like would fit into the area of the canvas.”” </p>

Floods and fires have slowly filled my work as the environment continues to change beyond all historical norms. Then came the virus - and isolation. Although there are small signs of incremental changes to air quality and wildlife patterns, brought on by the stay-at-home mandates, the earth has not stopped calling out in distress. The water keeps rising, even if we aren’t watching it as closely.”</p>

     <h3> <i>Admitted (2019)</i> </h3>

    </center>
    
    <p> Edmonton artist Brenda Draney, who is Cree from the Sawridge First Nation, knows a thing or two about hospitals. A few years back, her mother had quadruple bypass surgery. A year or so later, her partner was admitted to hospital for treatment of a kidney stone. In both instances, Draney was at their side. (Both her mother and her partner survived.) Reflecting on these experiences, she produced an exhibition of works titled “Smelling Salts.” Her painting Admitted, from this series, records her partner at the hospital. Today, this intimate connection with the afflicted looks like a luxury. Thousands are now unable to accompany their loved ones stricken by COVID-19 as they face their fates. “For so many hours you just memorize their face and their hands and their skin,” Draney told me, remembering her days spent at the bedside. “You say: that’s my loved one. You look for the changes. Their skin looks more sallow. They seem to have lost weight. They seem to have gained weight. You watch. What is painting but empathy with the artist’s hand.” </p>
